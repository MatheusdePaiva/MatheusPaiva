# 👋 Hey there! I'm a Computer Science and Full Stack Dev Student

Welcome to my GitHub!

I’m diving into the world of tech as a Computer Science and Full Stack Development student. I’ve got a solid grip on JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python, and I’m playing around with frameworks like React and Node.js to build cool and functional projects.

- Learning about databases and how to make things run smoothly.
